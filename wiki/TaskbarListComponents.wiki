#summary Components for making life easier when using the new Windows 7 Taskbarlist interfaces

=== What are TaskbarList components? ===

TaskbarListComponents are a set of components designed as Delphi wrappers for the Windows 7 Taskbarlist Interfaces (e.g. [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd391692%28VS.85%29.aspx ITaskbarlist3])


=== What's in the box? ===

Currently TUO's TaskbarList components support the following features:
  * *[TTaskbarListProgress]* - wrapper for connecting Delphi progress bars to the taskbar item of the application
  * *[TTaskBarListOverlayIcon]* - easily add an overlay icon to the taskbar item of your application
  * *[TTaskBarListThumbButtons]* - manage your application's thumb buttons in the taskbar
  * *[TTaskbarListFormTab]* - display any of your forms as separate tabs in the taskbar
  * *[TTaskbarListControlTab]* - display any control as separate tab in the taskbar

=== How to install? ===

The folder contains the package for Delphi 2009 already. Simply make a package for your own Delphi version if it is not already there.
